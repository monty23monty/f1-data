Telemetry Tool plugin for AC

Version 1.1

# What this plugin does
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This plugin reads data from the game, namely the data for
other drivers (AI or human) and sends the data over UDP to 
127.0.0.1:10101.

If you need to change the IP/Port, you can edit the .ini
file in the package.

When you use this plugin with the Telemetry Tool, the Telemetry
Tool will show other cars data, including
- position on trackmap
- sector times/laptimes
- race history and status etc.

# How to install this plugin.

You have two options:
1) install the plugin in the .zip file with Content Manager
	or 
2) unzip the .zip file to <assetto corsa install dir>

# How to uninstall this plugin
------------------------------------------------------------------
If you used Content Manager, use it to remove the plugin.

If you just unzipped the plugin, delete the Telemetry_Tool_plugin
directory in the <assetto corsa install dir>\apps\python directory
